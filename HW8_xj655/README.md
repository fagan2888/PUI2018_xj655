## Assign1 - Data Visualization
In the part, I work on the idea that in New York City whether the housing rent will be higher for apartment and house which are nearby subway entrance.
The datasets I found are:
> NYC Shapefile data by PUMA
> NYC Housing rent cost by PUMA
> NYC subway entry shapefile data from NYC Open Data
The plot is as followed.

Caption: This is the NYC housing rent cost and subway stations by PUMA. The yellow means higher cost and the dark purple means lower. The blue scatter describes the subway stations. In downtown, the area with higher cost has higher station number. However, in the surburb, the the rent price also increases without the same increasingly density of subway stations.
