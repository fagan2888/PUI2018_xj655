# Peer review for plot 
## Author: Yushi Chen(yc3763)
### Clarity: 
Your plot shows the NYC housing rental price and the distribution of the subway stations. Your plot is very clear and covered the information you want to deliver. And there are no confusion elements that contains in your plot. 

+ Suggection: 
1.  You can add the legend for the plot. 
2.  You mentioned about surburb in your caption, but it is unclear by only seeing the map. Clearify the surburb part will be very helpful. 


### Esthetic:
The color choosing for your subway stations are very clear; however, the color for housing price needs some improvement, becuase the color you choosed may not be significantly help the reader to understand the price difference.


### Honesty:
The plot is honest and doesnt deform the data. The process of code seems logical.
