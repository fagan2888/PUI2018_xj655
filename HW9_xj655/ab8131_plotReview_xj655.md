# Peer review for plot 
## Author: Xiao Jing(xj655)
### Clarity: 
The plot if very clear that it shows the recent years average math score in NYC. The labels and the title is also very berif and the whole plot is persuasive the NYC math score is increasing and the plot is easy to understand. 
+ Suggection: 
1.  How about adding the legend since the line plot from the first sight will be misunderstood as increasing rate.

### Esthetic:
Very nice and simple plot.
+ Suggection: 
1. Since the background has a lot of white space, people will find it hard to read how many score for each year. I will recommend show the Y axis grid. Or make the absolute num to bar and add ratio line.

### Honesty:
The process of code seems logical. But I haven't find the file in the repository and cannot reproduce.

One more question: Add caption.
