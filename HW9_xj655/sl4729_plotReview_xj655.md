# Peer review for plot

## Plot1-manhattan district
### Clarity: 
The plot is great to use geopandas to  annotate all the districts in Manhattan.
+ Suggection: 
1.  Usually we plot the NYC map by borough or specific area , here I see Manhattan + Brooklyn Height  make less sense. Could you explain more in caption?
2. Recommand  to change bins/units of x axis and y axis to map the Manhattan in a more real format.

### Esthetic:
Very nice and simple plot. Each district has the name annotation on it and it's clear to recognize each area.
+ Suggection: 
1. 

### Honesty:
The process of code seems logical. But I the first part of data wrangling seems meaningless.

## Plot2-manhattan bike monthly counts
### Clarity: 
The plot has good idea to use geopandas to  show the bike taking freqency monthly in Manhattan. However, the info of the plot what to express is not that clear.
+ Suggection: 
1.  Add legend to the plot.
2. Recommand  to change bins/units of x axis and y axis to map the Manhattan in a more real format.

### Esthetic:
Very straight to show the bike counts each districs with color change from dark red to light yellow.
+ Suggection: 
1. Make the title size bigger
2. You can also try to take annotation to each area like what you did in plot 1

### Honesty:
The process of code seems logical. But I the first part of data wrangling seems meaningless.
